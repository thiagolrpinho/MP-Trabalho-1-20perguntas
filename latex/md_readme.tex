The game consists of a series of Yes or No questions until it get on an answer. If the answer and what the user thought at the start of the game are equal, the program wins. If they differ, the game will ask the player for the right answer and which question answering yes would lead to this right answer. The game will get more questions and right answer after more plays. It\textquotesingle{}s possible to save a game, load an anterior game, to start a new game or to edit an already loaded one.

\subsection*{How to play}

First clone this repository.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

You need g++ installed which is native from ubuntu.

\subsubsection*{Installing}

After extracting it, enter on the folder using your terminal and write 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Play it}

After that, write on your console\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./play\_game
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Running the tests}

On the folder you installed your Game of 20 Questions, write in the terminal\+: To make a program to run all the tests\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make all\_tester
\end{DoxyCode}
 If you want to see the tests before running it, write\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./all\_tester --list-tests
\end{DoxyCode}
 Or just run it using 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./all\_tester 
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Warning The all\+\_\+tester is not fully automatized because I\textquotesingle{}m new to catch library of tests and don\textquotesingle{}t know how to automatize input and output on terminal tests. This happens only with tests\+\_\+game\+\_\+interface.\+cpp}

\subsubsection*{Running other tests}

To run other tests just go to the main folder of the project\+: To test only the Binary Tree used on the game. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make btree\_tester
\end{DoxyCode}


Beside the previous tests, if you want to test too the game statements of the game\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make game\_statement\_tester
\end{DoxyCode}


If you want to test too the game engine\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make game\_engine\_tester
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Gcov Test}

If you have gcov and gcovr installed, you can generate the test coverture of the binary tree by typing\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make gcov\_btree
\end{DoxyCode}
 And then\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./gcov\_btree
\end{DoxyCode}
 After this you can type\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make gcovr\_html
\end{DoxyCode}


You can additionally check game statements and game engine by changing {\itshape gcov\+\_\+btree} for {\itshape gcov\+\_\+statement} or {\itshape gcov\+\_\+engine} respectively on the previous list of instruction. You can also just genereate for all tests by doing\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make gcov\_tester
\end{DoxyCode}
 And then\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./gcov\_tester
\end{DoxyCode}
 After this you can type\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make gcovr\_html
\end{DoxyCode}
 To generate a graphical representantion of how much the code is abranged by the tests.

{\itshape I must warn that Gcov is not associating all my tests to the code its protect. I\textquotesingle{}m not sure why. But when I found I\textquotesingle{}ll fix it.}

{\itshape Warning The gcov\+\_\+tester is not fully automatized because I\textquotesingle{}m new to catch library of tests and don\textquotesingle{}t know how to automatize input and output on terminal tests. This happens only with tests\+\_\+game\+\_\+interface.\+cpp}

\subsection*{More information}

There\textquotesingle{}s a folder created with doxygen that contains an interactive way to see the classes and methods useds in the game. Also there\textquotesingle{}s an pdf on the main folder named\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 metodos.pdf
\end{DoxyCode}
 With each method used, what it does(in portuguese) and a list of the tests used to validate each one of them. \subsection*{Built With}
